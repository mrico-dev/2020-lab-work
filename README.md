# 01/2020 to 09/2020 work at LRDE

You will find in this repository most of my public work on the subject 'Verifying Properties on a Program Using Static Analysis and Model Checking'
while I worked as a research student at LRDE between 01/2020 and 09/2020.

report.pdf is my final report on subject.
The *'code/'* directory contains the code described in the report.

A huge thanks to my supervisor Adrien Pommellet who guided me throught this project and corrected my work report.
